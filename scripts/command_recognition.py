## \file command_recognition.py 
## \brief The node command_recognition.py recognize vocal command converted as String and publish the associated robot's action
## @n The vocal command "Miro" bring the robot in a default configuration and enables the processing of further commands.
## @n Different commands are managed. Each command publishes a message of type platform_control with the corresponding action.
## @n The action are handled independently by separated nodes. 
## @n The current node subscribes to them and, when the associated command is received, publishes on MiRo the msg content.

##\brief The class CommandRecognition handles the different incoming commands and publish on the robot the corresponding action
